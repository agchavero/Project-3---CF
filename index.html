                    <h3 id="cf-text">Cystic Fibrosis, also known as CF, is a progressive, genetic disease that affects the lungs, pancreas and other organs. The defective gene causes a thick, build up of mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs which leads to infections, extensive lung damage and eventually respiratory failure. It is the most common, fatal genetic disease in the United States with no cure for it currently.</h3>

                    <h3 id="percentage-text">This disease can affect all races and thnic groups. 1 in 25 people are carriers of the CF gene. It is important to get tested as 1 in 4 could have Cystic Fibrosis as long as both parents have atleast one copy of the mutated gene. If you experience salty skin, chronic respiratory problems, trouble with digestion, and bone issues, it is a good idea to get tested for CF. The sooner it is diagnosed the better.</h3>
